    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Interactive Content is based on a container based system.
      There are four main components in an Interactive Content file: Layouts,
      Containers, Actions, and Content. Each container follows a defined Layout.
      Containers themselves can include Containers or have Content. Content objects
      must be inside a container for them to be displayed. Actions can link
      containers, and must be a part of a Content object.
