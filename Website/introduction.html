    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Interactive Content is based on a container based system.
      There are five main components in an Interactive Content file: Layouts,
      Containers, Actions, Styles, and Content. Each container follows a defined Layout.
      Containers themselves can include Containers or have Content. Content objects
      must be inside a Container for them to be displayed. Actions are used to
      build relationships between containers, and must be a part of a Content object.
    </p>

    <h3>Updatability</h3>
    <p>
      A key feature to Interactive Content is its integration with the web. Interactive
      Content allows both displaying entire webpages as Content and retrieving native Content
      from web endpoints. This allows a single Interactive Content file to be used to define
      the structure of Content, yet have the content itself be up to date without changing the
      file itself.
